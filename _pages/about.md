I am a Web developer at [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), IIIT Hyderabad](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) 
I am working under Professor [Prof. C V Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/)  and [IHub Data Foundation (IIITH IHub Data Foundation)](https://ihub-data.iiit.ac.in/).

My primary area of interest is in website development to design the creative website. Specifically, I am interested in Front End Developer, Back End Developer and Full Stack Developer.

Before IIIT-H, I join the [ICICI Academy for Skills](https://icicifoundation.org/), Hyderabad. I led the recommendation and suggestion team for the Web Designing on HTML, CSS and Javascript to develop Static Website.

In 2020, I travelled to [Uttar Pradesh]() to collect the 300+ hrs of data for the [EGO 4D](https://ego4d-data.org/) project with Collaboration of [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-ai-to-perceive-the-world-through-your-eyes/).
In the mean, I was coordinating with my team members in Kerala, Bengal, Gujarat, Telangana, and Andra Pradesh to complete the 1000 hrs of data capture for [EGO4D](https://ego4d-data.org/) Project.

In 2021, I travelled to Goa, Yadagirigutta, Vikarabad, Warangal and whole Telangana for the Data collection with [Mobility Bodhyaan Platform](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/mobility/) for  [iRaste-Telangana Project](https://inai.iiit.ac.in/iraste.html).

In my free time, I like to read new python library reletaed to Compurter Vision and Machione Learning.
